1,Portugal,Avidagos,87,15,Douro,,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Quinta dos Avidagos 2011 Avidagos Red (Douro),Portuguese Red,Quinta dos Avidagos,"This is ripe and fruity, a wine that is smooth while still structured. Firm tannins are filled out with juicy red berry fruits and freshened with acidity. It's  already drinkable, although it will certainly be better from 2016."
