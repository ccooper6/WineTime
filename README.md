2. Ensure git is selected for the Version Control and paste the repository URL.
3. Select a directory to save the project and click `Clone`.
4. Once the project is cloned, click `Open`.
5. At this point in the bottom right notifications you may be prompted to 'load gradle scripts', If so, click load

**Note:** If you encounter dependency issues or the Gradle pop-up doesn't appear, open the Gradle sidebar and click the `Refresh` icon.

## Building the Project
Open a command line interface inside the project directory and run:
```sh
./gradlew build
```

The built `WineTime.jar` file will be located in the `build/libs` directory within the project directory.

### From a built .jar file
- Open a command line interface into the directory where the built `WineTime.jar` file is located and run:

```sh
java -jar WineTime.jar

The WineTime application will launch and you can begin your wine journey! On the first launch, a copy database will be generated in the same directory
as the jar file. This database stores all 130k+ wines in addition to user data. 

**Important:** Please do not delete the `WineTime.db` file as it is required for the application to function.
